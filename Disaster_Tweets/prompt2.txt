Given the tweet text provided, determine whether it represents a real disaster (actual events like earthquakes, floods, fires, etc.) or not. Analyze the context deeply, focusing on specific disaster-related keywords, mentions of locations, any temporal references, and the overall tone. Consider the broader situational context and subtleties in language use. In cases of ambiguity, where the tweet could reasonably be about a real disaster based on the context and use of language, classify as a real disaster. Your response should be a single number: 1 if the tweet is about a real disaster, and 0 if it is not.
